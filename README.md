## About The Project

Application web - MesBouquins : La biblioth√®que standard

Sujet 2 du projet, CRUD basique.

## Versioning

We chose to adopt the **Feature Branch** but instead of merging into main, we chose to create a branch called **dev** and merge into it instead.
This may not be a conventional way of doing things, but having a branch for the developpement environnement makes it clearer for us and is a way to test **all** our features before merging into the main branch.
